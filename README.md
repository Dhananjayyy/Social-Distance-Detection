At the center of the project is the Python Flask Application. The Python Flask application first starts the Flask Server. 

The user is presented with the user interface of the program. 
Then login and registration details are stored securely with SQL database. 

The user can reuse the login credentials with the help of secure storage.
Upon successfully authentication of the user, the next stage is object detection. 

However, the user is redirected to the dashboard page which provides a button to start and stop the object detection process as per his/her will.


After the object detection process is started, the output results are produced. It contains the social distance status and processed frames. 

These then are transferred to the User Interface and shown to the user.

The central Flask server handles this seamlessly.
